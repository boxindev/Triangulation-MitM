# Triangulating MitM Attack
The folders are:
- `AES`: the code to search for MitM key recovery attacks on AES.
- `AES-full`: the code to search for MitM key recovery attacks on 4-full-round AES.
- `Rijndael-EM`: the code to search for MitM key recovery attacks on Rijndael-EM.
- `ascon`: the code to search for MitM preimage attacks on ascon.
- `Gimli`: the code to search for MitM preimage attacks on Gimli.
- `keccak-mitm-preimage-512`: the code to search for MitM preimage attacks on Keccak-512.
- 'keccak-mitm-preimage-512-EU2023': the code to search for MitM preimage attacks on Keccak-512 using the same initial structure of the paper in EUCRYPTO 2023.
- `Keccak-mitm-preimage-384`: the code to search for MitM preimage attacks on Keccak-384.
- `Xoodyak`: the code to search for MitM preimage attacks on Xoodyak.
- `Experiment`: the code of small-scale experiments on hashing model of AES-256.
- 'MATRIX': Since the matrices of Keccak and Xoodyak are too large to show them in the paper, we put them in the MATRIX folder.
- `newlibs`: the dependent libraries.
